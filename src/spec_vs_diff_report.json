  "summary": "The diff implements PWA conversion with manifest, service worker, and install hook, plus updates the app name to 'Bachelor Room Finder'. However, REQ-9 (PWA icon generation) is not evidenced in the diff, and there is no evidence that the user was asked for their preferred app name as required by REQ-10.",

      "requirement": "Generate PWA icon assets in multiple sizes (192x192, 512x512) for the room rental application with a home/room themed design",
      "reason": "The manifest.json references icon files at /assets/generated/pwa-icon-192.dim_192x192.png and /assets/generated/pwa-icon-512.dim_512x512.png, but no actual icon file additions are shown in the diff. Only 3 files were added (usePWAInstall.ts, manifest.json, service-worker.js), and none are image files.",

      "reason": "While REQ-8 requires implementing a service worker and install prompts, it does not explicitly request a UI button in the navigation component. The install prompt capability is expected, but the specific UI implementation with a Download button in Navigation.tsx goes beyond the stated requirements.",
