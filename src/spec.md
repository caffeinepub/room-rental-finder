# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Convert the Room Rental Finder application to a Progressive Web App (PWA) and update the application name throughout.

**Planned changes:**
- Add PWA manifest file with app metadata, icons, theme colors, and standalone display mode
- Implement service worker for offline capability, caching, and installation prompts
- Generate PWA icon assets in multiple sizes (192x192, 512x512) with room rental theme
- Update application name consistently across all user-facing locations (title, manifest, navigation)

**User-visible outcome:** Users can install the application to their device home screen like a native app, use it offline, and see the updated application name throughout the interface.
